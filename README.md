# Loot Box Opening Simulation

This Shiny app is built using Shinylive, which allows it to run entirely on the frontend without the need for a server. However, this also means that it may take some time to load in the web browser. 

A common loot box scheme in games involves collecting a series of collectibles to earn the final reward. To acquire these collectibles, players must open cases that drop one collectible at a time, with the possibility of receiving duplicates. An exchange system often allows players to trade duplicate collectibles for new ones at a specified rate. The key question is: what is the probability of obtaining the final reward after opening a certain number of boxes?

The app simulates 1,000 runs to determine the probability of successfully collecting the final reward when opening loot boxes in games.
